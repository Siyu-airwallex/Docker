Images are read only templates used to create containers
Images are created with the docker build command
Images are composed of layers of other images
Images are stored in a Docker registry


If an image is a class, then a container is an instance of a class - a runtime object
Containers are lightweight and portable encapsulations of an environment in which to run applications
Containers are created from images, Inside a container, it has all the binaries and dependencies needed to run the application

A registry is where we store our images, like DockerHub
Inside a registry, images are stored in repositories.
Docker repository is a collection of different images,with the same name, that have different tags, each tag represents a different version of that image.


Image Layers
All changes made into the running containers will be written into writable layer.
When the container is deleted, the writable layer is also deleted, but the underlying images remains unchanged
Multiple containers can share access to the same underlying image



command:

	docker info
	docker version
	docker images
	docker run 7e3fd1d11c95
	docker run 7e3fd1d11c95 echo "hello docker"  //docker run repository:tag command [arguments]
	docker run busybox:1.24 echo "hello world"
	docker run busybox:1.24 ls /
	docker run -i -t busybox:1.24               // '-i' starts an interactive container
	docker run -d busybox:1.24 sleep 1000  // run the container in the background, return container id
	docker stop ebb6fae6176f
	docker ps                                   // check all running docker containers in local computer
	docker ps -a                                  // all containers previously ran
	docker run --rm  busybox:1.24 sleep 1                 // remove container after it exit
	docker run --name hello_world busybox;1.24           // specify the container name
	docker inspect 0e0479e0d0942b236b70e             //display the low level information of container or image
	docker run -it -p 8888:8080 tomcat:8.0
	docker run -it -d -p 8888:8080 tomcat:8.0        //mapping container port 8080 into host port 8888
	docker logs c265f34b2b3ffc29d7964d984d5bb72f746a8d838f94c54e664d40e6267c102a          //check container logs
	docker history busybox:1.24



Push docker image into dockerhub.	

	docker tag 3b3f30d45f63 charliefeng/debian:1.1   //asscoicate docker image with dockerhub account
	docker login --username=charliefeng
	docker push charliefeng/debian:1.1


#Eg start a containerized applicaiton, python flask
	docker run -d -p 5000:5000 e042997e8fc       //
	docker exec -it 9865d0963643 bash   // 'exec' allows run a command in a running container
    


 # Use link to connect two cotainers
	docker run -d --name redis redis:3.2.0
	docker build -t dockerapp:v0.3 .
	docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --link redis dockerapp:v0.3  //link two container


Two ways to build a docker image

	1. Manually commit changes made in a Docker container

		Spin up a container from a base image
		Install Git package in the container
		Commit changes made in the container

        eg.
            docker run -it debian:jessie
                apt-get update && apt-get install -y git
                exit
            docker ps -a
    
            docker commit ab40d05ae574 siyu/debian:1.0
            docker run -it siyu/debian:1.0


	2. Write a Dockerfile

		Chain RUN Instructions
			Each RUN command will execute the command on the top writtalbe layer of the container, then commit the container as a new image
			The new image is used for the next step in the Dockerfile. So each RUN instruction will create a new image layer
			It is recommended to chain the RUN instructions in the Dockerfile to reduce the number of image layers it creates

		Sort Multi-line Arguments Alphanumerically
			To avoid duplication of packages


		CMD Instructions

			The CMD instruction doesn't run when building the image, it only runs when the container starts up
			You can specify the command in either exec form which is perferred or in shell form

		Docker Cache

			Each time Docker executes an instruction it builds a new image layer
			The next time, if the instruction doesn't change, Docker will simply reuse the existing layer


		Instrunction :
			FROM
			RUN: better to chain
			CMD: specify some command that will be executed after container 	start up
			COPY: copy file from local system to the container (Recommended)
			ADD: not only copy file but also download file from internet and copy to container, ability to unpack compressed file


        eg.
            docker build -t siyu/debian .
            docker run 3b3f30d45f63 echo "hello docker"     // overwrite CMD instructions
            docker build -t siyu/debian . --no-cache=true 



Docker Compose

	Docker compose is a handy tool to defining and running multi-container Docker applications.

	Docker compose uses yaml files to store the configuration of all containers, which removes the burden to maintain our scripts for docker orchestration


	command:
		docker-compose up //starts up all the containers
		docker-compose up -d
		docker-compse down
		docker-compose ps
		docker-compose logs
		docker-compose logs -f // outputs appended logs when logs grows
		docker-compose stop // stop all running containers without removing them
		docker-compose rm  // rm all containers
		docker-compose build  // rebuild all the images

		docker-compose run dockerapp python test.py  // execute command in running service

		docker-compose run dockerapp python test.py    // run unit test inside containers



Docker Network

	Type:
				Closed Network/ None Network
				Bridge Network
				Host Network
				Overlay Network

	command:
		docker network ls

		//Test for Closed Network: outside network access is non-reachable
		docker run -d --net none busybox sleep 1000
		docker exec -it 900082c21125c402465d27d26483165d2030c787215ab93c6c63821da298583d /bin/ash

		//Test Bridge Network, containers within the same bridge can talk to each other and outside.(Most common)
		docker network inspect bridge
		run -d --name container_1 busybox sleep 1000
		docker exec -it c401f2bbea94 ifconfig

	  docker run -d --name container_2 busybox sleep 1000
		docker exec -it 7fc4a855f77c  ifconfig
		docker exec -it container_1 ping 172.17.0.3
		docker exec -it container_1 ping 8.8.8.8

		docker network create --driver bridge my_bridge_network
		docker network inspect my_bridge_network

		docker run -d --name container_3 --net my_bridge_network busybox sleep 1000
		docker exec -it container_3 ping 172.17.0.2  // ping denied

		docker network connect bridge container_3
		docker exec -it container_3 ifconfig
		docker exec -it container_3 ping 172.17.0.2  // ping success

		docker network disconnect bridge container_3
		docker exec -it container_3 ifconfig


		//Test Host Network, containers have full access to host network interface, the least protected network model
		docker run -d --name container_4 --net host busybox sleep 1000
		docker exec -it container_4 ifconfig

		//Overlay Network, support multi-host networking out-of-the-box
		//Require some pre-existing conditions before it can be created
			- Running Docker engine in Swarm mode
			- A key-value store such as consul
